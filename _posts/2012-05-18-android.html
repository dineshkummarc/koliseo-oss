<h2>Welcome to Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</h2>

<p><a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koliseo.android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> is the free Android application that validates tickets for your events. To use this application you must have a working Koliseo account with programmed shows.

<ol>
	<li><p>The login process is the same used by the website.

	<li><p>From here you can display the list of scheduled performances by clicking the first button.
	<p><img src="/img/android/performances.png" class="help-img">
	<p>To start validating tickets, just click the button in the middle. Your display should switch to camera mode, where you can scan tickets by displaying the QR code (the dotted square) centered inside the red horizontal line. If the code is not being recognized try putting it farther away.

</ol>

<p>While validating, the number of validated and rejected tickets is displayed at the bottom right corner of your screen. Even if you are using the Android validator, you may want to prepare a printed <a href="/attendees-list">list of attendees</a> to take with you, just in case.

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
	<b>Did you know?</b> you can validate tickets printed on paper or directly from the screen of another cell phone.

<h2>Why the name?</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a> was the crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. It was a cold night of March and we were lazily wondering a good name. We just reproduced the complex train of thought that made others arrive to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/d1064f7b27808692?pli=1">the number 42</a>.

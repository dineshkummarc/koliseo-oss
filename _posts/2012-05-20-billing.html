<h3>What is the cost of using Koliseo?</h3>
<p>Koliseo is a free platform for event organizers. It operates on a fee charged over the ticket price that is paid with the ticket purchase. Everything else, including <a href="/android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> for Android, is free.

<h3>What fee does Koliseo apply over the ticket price?</h3>
<p>The fee is 7% of the ticket price, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 of the event currency. The following is a conversion table for euros:
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr> <th>Ticket price <th>Applicable fee </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr> <td>between 0.01 and 14 EUR<td>1 EUR</tr>
		<tr> <td>between 15 and 214 EUR<td>7% of the ticket price</tr>
		<tr> <td>above 215 EUR<td>15 EUR</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>What about free events?</h3>
<p>Free tickets are exempt of the minimum fee. If you are not making any income out of your event, we neither.

<h3>Which currencies does Koliseo support?</h3>
<p>At the current time we support payment in USD (US dollars), EUR (euros) and GBP (British pounds). Money transfers are executed in the same currency of the event.

<h3>How do I receive payment for my sold tickets?</h3>
<p>In order to receive payment you must first have introduced your payment data. On your user profile page click "Edit" and go to the "Payment data" tab.
<p>Koliseo will allow you to introduce your event, but as soon as we have pending money transfers you will receive a reminder periodically to introduce your payment data. 
 
<h3>When do I receive payment for my sold tickets?</h3>
<p>Transfers are executed during the week after your performance takes place.

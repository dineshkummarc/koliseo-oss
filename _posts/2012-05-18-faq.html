<h3 id="beta">What does <i>beta</i> mean?</h3>
<p>Koliseo is a platform still under development. "Beta" means that we still have wrinkles to iron and it's possible that at some point the application does not behave as expected. We are working hard to avoid this, but sometimes it happens.

<h3 id="create-account">How do I create my user account?</h3>
<p>Koliseo does not manage user accounts. Instead, you can use any of the user account providers available in the login page. All of them also allow you to create a new user account for free. Koliseo does never have access to your password at any time.

<h3 id="avatar">How do I change my avatar?</h3>
<p>The avatar (the picture associated to your user account) can be configured at 
<a href="http://gravatar.com">gravatar.com</a>. Just create an account with your user e-mail and upload your new profile picture.

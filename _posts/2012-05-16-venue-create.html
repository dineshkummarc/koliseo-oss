<h3>Venue data</h3>

<p>The first step is similar to <a href="/show-create">show creation</a>.

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The location of the venue will be used to direct attendees to the performance location, as well as keep shows indexed by location. You can introduce any address that is recognized by Google Maps. If a certain address is not found, try to make it more concrete by adding elements such as the city or the country. 

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
	<b>Did you know?</b> Most of the time it is enough to introduce just the name of the venue and select it from the list of options.
</div>

<p><img src="/img/edit-address.png" class="help-img"> 

<p>You can also modify the time zone and currency of the venue, that will default to your current time zone and EUR. All performances created for this venue will be considered relative to this time zone and currency.

<h3>Auditoriums</h3>

<p>Auditoriums are rooms to hold performances in your venue. Your newly created venue comes with one default auditorium with capacity for 100 attendees. You may add or remove new auditoriums, modify the auditorium name or its zones and prices.

<p>An auditorium is a template for future performances; whenever you create a new show and link it to this auditorium the capacity and ticket prices will be automatically filled in for you (still, you may edit these values later).

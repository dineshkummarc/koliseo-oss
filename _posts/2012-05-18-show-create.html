<h3>Event data</h3>

<p>During this first step you must introduce a name and description for your event. When introducing the description there are some tools that allow some basic formatting (bold, italics) as well as introducing links to other content.

<h3>Photos and videos</h3>

<p>It is extremely recommended that you select some photos and videos to go with your show and really make it shine.

<ol>
	<li><p>Click on "Search photos" or "Search videos"
	<li><p>Introduce your search term and click search. Search will be performed on Flickr and Youtube.

	<li><p>You can select an image by clicking on it, and it will be marked as selected. Click over it again to unselect it.

	<li><p>Videos will require a preview before selecting it. Click "Add" to select the video or "Cancel" to skip it.
	<li><p>Once you are done click "Accept" to add the selected photos or videos to the show page.
</ol>

<p>It's important to use only material that you are authorized to include. If you want to upload new photos or videos you can do that in the Flickr and Youtube websites.

	<b>Did you know?</b> Instead of a search term, you can directly introduce a URL pointing to Flickr or Youtube.
</div>

<h3>Where and when</h3>

<p>You must specify the date and place where this show is taking place. 

<ol>
	<li><p>Select the venue from your venues list or click <a href="venue-create">Create new venue</a> to create a new one. 
	<p><img src="/img/select-venue.png" class="help-img"> 
	<li><p>Once a venue and auditorium gets selected, a performance is created copying the auditorium data. It can be modified to fit the capacity and prices for this particular performance (use 0 for free events). You should also set the date and time where this performance will take place.

</ol>

The fee is what we use to pay our invoices. We charge 7% (tax included) of the ticket sale price to events that are not free, with 1 EUR/USD minimum and 15 EUR/USD maximum. The fee is calculated automatically and it cannot be modified.

<div class="alert-message block-message info">
	<b>Did you know?</b> You can select as many locations and dates as you wish. Instead of a Birthday Party, you can start a <b>Birthday Tour</b>.
</div>

<h3>Activate</h3>

<p>In this step you can mark your event as "Unlisted". Unlisted events are not included in public listings such as the search results page and your public profile page. They are also not indexed by Google Search Engine.
<p>Once the show is complete, click the Finish button and you will be redirected to the public show page. If you have second thoughts, you can still edit your show using the "Edit" button at the top of the page. 
<p>Congratulations, your show is ready to start selling! Just share the link with your friends and colleagues.

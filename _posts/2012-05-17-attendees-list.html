<h2>Manual validation</h2>

<p>To validate tickets using a list of attendees, prepare a pen and start checking out tickets. You should verify:

<ol>
	<li>The localizer ID.
	<li>The user name.
	<li>The number of tickets.
</ol>

<p>You can choose to print the list of attendees by localizer or by user name.

<p>If you don't have a Google Analytics account you may create one for free <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">here</a>.

<p>After clicking save you should typically wait one day until the server gets significant data, but you can check that it has been properly configured using the <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real-time reports in Google Analytics</a>. 

<h2>Recorded data</h2>

	<li>You can track online sources such as blogs and social networks linking to your show page.
	<li>You can relate pricing to changes in your conversion rate.
	<li>Analyze the shows that are getting most attention and identify why.
	<li>Get access to over 80 customized reports.
</ul>
